    <h1>Brazilian Mom Style Garlic Rice</h1>
    <p>Mom! Miss you! &#9829;</p>

    <ol class="list-of-instructions">
      <li>
        <p>Before you start, gather the following and make a nicely arranged, aesthetic composition on a clean surface:</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_01.jpg">
        <ul class="list-of-ingredients">
          <li>
            <p>2 cups of parboiled rice</p>
            <!--
            <img src="./images/parboiled rice.webp">-->
          </li>
          <li><p>If you're feeling healthy (and you should), add a ½ cup of quinoa to your rice</p></li>
          <li><p>2 tablespoons of butter, OR enough olive oil to make a thin layer on the bottom of the pan you're using</p></li>
          <li><p>3 medium-sized garlic <s>teeth (is that how you call it in English?)</s> clovers</p></li>
          <li><p>A nicely sized saucepan (3–4 quarts is good!) with a perforated lid (if the lid is not perforated, you're gonna have to place it slightly off for the vapor to go out)</p></li>
          <li><p>Around 1 liter water</p></li>
          <li><p>A chopping board</p></li>
          <li><p>A sharp knife</p></li>
          <li><p>A heat-safe silicon or wooden cooking spoon</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Get your water on a kettle and leave it heating while you do the rest.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_02.jpg"></li>   
        <li>
        <p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27ctXr_20E>Peel the garlic like a professional would.</a> That means you will use the side of your knife to press it against the chopping board and the peel will come off beautifully.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_03.jpg">
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_04.jpg"> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After you've peeled it, throw the peel away.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_05.jpg"></li>
      <li>
        <p>That's because you want to keep your cooking area always clean.</p>
        <img src="./images/Clean-desk.gif"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look at how beautiful it is.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_06.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use the side of your knife again to smash it into smaller pieces.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_07.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>If it's not enough, chop it more. It should be tiny but not a paste.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_08.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Get your pan on the stove and put that butter or olive oil in.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_10.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you put butter, add a drop of olive oil (that will prevent your butter from burning)</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_12.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn on the stove to a medium-high temperature.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_11.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>You will know when the pan is hot enough by shaking it gently: if the butter/oil flows easily from one side to the other, it's good to go.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_13.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add your nicely, professionally chopped garlic, and shake the pan so that there is no garlic over garlic and all of it gets evenly fried.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_14.jpg"> 
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_15.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>When your garlic turns golden (but before it turns brown), put the rice (and quinoa if applicable) into the pan.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_16.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use your cooking spoon to mix garlic and rice: you're frying the rice for about 2 minutes.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_17.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn the stove temperature down to medium.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_11.jpg"> </li>
      <li><p>Is the water boiling yet? I hope so. In your non-dominant hand, get the perforated lid. In your dominant hand, get the water kettle.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_19.jpg"> </li>
      <li><p>Pour just enough water to fill the pan above the rice line by about ¾ of an inch. Use the lid as you do it to prevent a huge mess.</p>
        </li>
      <li><p>Stir it a little with your cooking spoon to make sure there's no rice above water.</p>
        </li>
      <li><p>Cover the pan with the perforated lid, or if the lid is not perforated, put it in a way that the vapour comes off easily.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_20.jpg"> </li>
      <li><p>Wait for about 8 minutes, but every once in a while go back and check if the water is completely gone. You can use your spoon to do so — my mom knows it by feeling the vibrations on the panhandle.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>When your rice sounds like it's frying, or the water level is low, add a second round of water in the same way you did before: just about ¾" above the rice line.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Wait for about 8 minutes again, but every once in a while go back and check if the water is completely gone.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the water level gets really low, turn the stove off and remove the lid for a few minutes. That will make your rice texture really nice.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_21.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look at this beautifully cooked rice! Time to place it on a serving dish and pair it with nearly anything you want.</p>
        <img src="./images/Garlic Rice_Step_24.jpg"> </li>
      <li>
        <p>Get all the dirty stuff and place them on the sink. You can deal with that after you've eaten your garlic rice.</p>
